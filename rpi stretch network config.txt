1)to use ethernet directly on the pi

naming has changed to enx
a)in /etc/network/interfaces:
comment out the source code line
auto enx... #need not do an if up,brought up on boot
iface enx.. inet manual #disable dhcp,use static ip only

#this checks for static config in dhcpcd.conf

b) in /etc/dhcpcd.conf
interface enx..mac
static ip_address ... #enter any address
static routers	#default gateway

do not change cmdline.txt,don't diable dhcp,reboot

2)to share internet connection using an ethernet cable:need etehrnet cable,xming(lxde gui using ssh and x forwarding),putty

enable sharing in network and sharing center for the wifi
Comp's IP:assign a static ip address(ip,gateway,netmask,dns server) to the ethernet adapter;check if this has taken effect using ipconfig/ifconfig
Pi's IP:assign a different ip address in the same subnet to the pi using steps 1a) and 1b);check if this ip has taken effect on the pi using ifconfig
network sharing is done

open putty,enable x11 forwarding under session
enter the pi's ip and start an ssh session
login
startlxde
